# AI Tennis Coach Web Application - System Design

## Implementation Approach

### Technology Stack Selection

#### Frontend
- **React**: For building a responsive and interactive single-page application
- **Tailwind CSS**: For streamlined, utility-first styling approach
- **Redux**: For state management across the application
- **WebRTC**: For real-time video processing capabilities
- **D3.js**: For rich data visualization and performance analytics
- **TensorFlow.js**: For client-side ML inference to support real-time analysis

#### Backend
- **Node.js**: For scalable API services and server-side operations
- **Express**: For RESTful API development
- **MongoDB**: For flexible document storage of user profiles and training data
- **PostgreSQL**: For structured storage of analytics data and relationships
- **Redis**: For caching and real-time features
- **Python**: For machine learning pipelines and computer vision algorithms
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For training ML models
- **OpenCV**: For computer vision operations

#### Infrastructure
- **AWS**: As the cloud platform providing the following services:
  - S3: For video storage
  - EC2/ECS: For hosting services
  - Lambda: For serverless video processing
  - CloudFront: For content delivery
  - Cognito: For user authentication
  - SQS: For message queuing in the video processing pipeline
- **Docker**: For containerization
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI or GitHub Actions

### Key Technical Challenges

1. **Real-time Video Analysis**
   - Solution: Implement WebRTC for browser-based video streaming and use TensorFlow.js for client-side pose estimation to provide immediate feedback. More complex analysis will be offloaded to cloud processing.

2. **Accurate Tennis Technique Recognition**
   - Solution: Develop specialized computer vision models trained on large datasets of tennis strokes. Use transfer learning to build upon established pose estimation models like OpenPose or BlazePose.

3. **Personalized Training Program Generation**
   - Solution: Create a recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering and user progress metrics to generate customized training programs.

4. **Scalable Video Processing Pipeline**
   - Solution: Implement a distributed processing system using AWS Lambda and SQS to handle video uploads, analysis, and storage efficiently.

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Solution: Use responsive design principles and progressive web app features to ensure seamless operation across various devices and browsers.

## System Architecture Overview

The AI Tennis Coach web application will follow a microservices architecture pattern with the following key components:

### 1. User Service
Manages user accounts, authentication, profiles, and subscription tiers.

### 2. Video Processing Service
Handles video upload, preprocessing, storage, and queuing for analysis.

### 3. Analytics Service
Processes videos to extract performance metrics, technique analysis, and improvement suggestions.

### 4. Training Program Service
Generates and manages personalized training programs based on user goals and analysis results.

### 5. Community Service
Manages social features, sharing capabilities, and coach-student connections.

### 6. Notification Service
Handles in-app notifications, email reminders, and progress updates.

### 7. API Gateway
Manages API routing, authentication, rate limiting, and serves as the entry point for frontend interactions.

## Data Flow

1. **Video Analysis Flow**:
   - User records or uploads video through the web interface
   - Video is preprocessed (compressed, formatted) and stored in S3
   - Analysis job is queued in SQS
   - Lambda workers process video using ML models
   - Results are stored in the database
   - User receives notification when analysis is complete
   - User views results through the analytics dashboard

2. **Training Program Generation Flow**:
   - User completes assessment or system analyzes recent performance
   - Algorithm identifies strengths and weaknesses
   - Training program service generates personalized drills and schedules
   - Program is presented to user via the dashboard
   - User completes training activities and logs results
   - System updates user profile with new progress data

3. **Real-time Analysis Flow**:
   - User enables camera access in web browser
   - WebRTC stream is processed in real-time using TensorFlow.js
   - Basic pose estimation and movement analysis happens client-side
   - Immediate feedback is provided through the interface
   - Session data is optionally saved to the user's history

## Scaling Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design services to be stateless for easy horizontal scaling
- **Async Processing**: Use message queues for video analysis to handle traffic spikes
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement multi-level caching for frequently accessed data like training programs and reference videos
- **CDN Usage**: Store and serve video content through CloudFront for global performance
- **Database Sharding**: Implement database sharding for user data as the platform grows

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token mechanism
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit for all user data
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for features and data
- **Privacy**: Fine-grained user consent for data usage, particularly for uploaded videos
- **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA compliance for global user base

## Monitoring and Analytics

- **User Analytics**: Track feature usage, engagement patterns, and subscription metrics
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of service health and performance
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error logging and alerting system
- **ML Model Monitoring**: Track model performance, accuracy, and drift over time
